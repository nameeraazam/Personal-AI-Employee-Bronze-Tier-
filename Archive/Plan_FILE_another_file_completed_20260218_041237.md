# Plan for file another file

- [ ] Review the content of the dropped file
- [ ] Decide required actions (e.g., archive, escalate, summarize)
- [ ] Execute basic next step if safe (no external actions in Bronze)
- [ ] Move original task file to Done/ when finished
- [ ] Log activity to Dashboard.md
